# Davide Bruno - Software Developer Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Davide Bruno, a passionate software developer focused on creating exciting and user-centric products.

## About Me

I specialize in modern web development with a strong focus on:
- React.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces
- Node.js for robust backend solutions
- Full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Creating engaging and intuitive user experiences

## My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, which you can visit at [brave-dave.com](https://brave-dave.com). Built with modern web technologies including:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - The React framework for production
- Modern web technologies and best practices
- Optimized performance and SEO
- Responsive design for all devices

## Development

This project uses [SST](https://sst.dev) for deployment and local development. SST provides a better development experience by:

- Running your Next.js app in a serverless environment locally
- Simulating AWS services for local development
- Providing hot reloading for both frontend and backend changes
- Enabling testing of serverless functions locally

Quick start:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the SST development environment
pnpm sst
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
